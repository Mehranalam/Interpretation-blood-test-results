This file acts as a bridge between the data classification process and the final interpretation of the blood tests. 
It helps to ensure that the results are based on a solid foundation of data analysis and that any anomalies or errors are identified and 
corrected before the tests are interpreted. By utilizing this file, medical professionals can 
have greater confidence in the accuracy of their blood test results, which can ultimately lead to better patient outcomes.3
