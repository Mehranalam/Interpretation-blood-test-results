## Blood Test Interpretation

### Hemoglobin (Hb): 12.5

* Within normal range (12.0 - 16.0 g/dL)
* Indicates adequate oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells

### WBC Count: 9000 cumm

* Within normal range (4500 - 11000 cumm)
* Suggests no significant infection or inflammation

### RBC Count: 5.2 mill/cumm

* Lower than normal range (4.2 - 5.9 mill/cumm)
* May indicate mild anemia

### Platelet Count: 150000 cumm

* Within normal range (150000 - 450000 cumm)
* Indicates normal blood clotting function

### PCV (Packed Cell Volume): 57.5 %

* Within normal range (42 - 52 %)
* Indicates the proportion of red blood cells in blood volume

### MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume): 87.75 fL

* Within normal range (80 - 100 fL)
* Suggests normal size of red blood cells

### MCH (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin): 27.2 pg

* Within normal range (27 - 32 pg)
* Indicates normal amount of hemoglobin in each red blood cell

### MCHC (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration): 32.8 g/dL

* Within normal range (32 - 36 g/dL)
* Indicates normal concentration of hemoglobin in red blood cells

### RDW (Red Cell Distribution Width): 13.6 %

* Within normal range (11.5 - 14.5 %)
* Indicates a slight variation in the size of red blood cells

### Differential White Blood Cell Count:

* **Neutrophils:** 60 %
* **Lymphocytes:** 31 %
* **Monocytes:** 7 %
* **Eosinophils:** 1 %
* **Basophils:** 1 %

* Normal distribution of white blood cell types
* No evidence of infection or inflammation

## Overall Summary:

Your blood test results suggest overall good health with no major abnormalities. The RBC count is slightly below normal, but it's not severe enough to be considered anemia. The RDW is slightly elevated, but it's within the normal range and not clinically significant.

**Recommendations:**

* Monitor your RBC count and RDW over time to ensure they remain within normal ranges.
* Discuss your blood test results with your doctor for further evaluation and guidance.
