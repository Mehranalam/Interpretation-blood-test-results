* **MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume):** 87.75 fL
    * Normal range: 80-97 fL
    * Interpretation: Normal, indicating the average size of red blood cells.
* **MCH (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin):** 27.2 pg
    * Normal range: 27-32 pg
    * Interpretation: Normal, indicating the average content of hemoglobin in red blood cells.
* **MCHC (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration):** 32.8 g/dL
    * Normal range: 32-36 g/dL

* **RDW (Red Cell Distribution Width):** 13.6%
    * Normal range: 11.5-14.5%
    * Interpretation: Normal, indicating a narrow variation in the size of red blood cells.

**Leukocyte Parameters:**

* **WBC Count:** 9000/cumm
    * Normal range: 4000-11000/cumm
    * Interpretation: Normal, indicating an appropriate number of white blood cells.
* **Neutrophils:** 60%
    * Normal range: 50-70%
    * Interpretation: Normal, indicating a normal proportion of neutrophils, which are white blood cells involved in combating infections.
* **Lymphocytes:** 31%
    * Normal range: 20-40%
    * Interpretation: Normal, indicating a normal proportion of lymphocytes, which are white blood cells involved in immune responses.
* **Monocytes:** 7%
    * Normal range: 3-9%
    * Interpretation: Normal, indicating a normal proportion of monocytes, which are white blood cells involved in phagocytosis (ingestion of foreign particles).
* **Eosinophils:** 1%
    * Normal range: 0.5-6%
    * Interpretation: Normal, indicating a normal proportion of eosinophils, which are white blood cells involved in defending against parasitic infections and allergies.
* **Basophils:** 1%
    * Normal range: 0-3%
    * Interpretation: Normal, indicating a normal proportion of basophils, which are white blood cells involved in allergic reactions and inflammation.

**Platelet Count:**

* **Platelet Count:** 150000/cumm
    * Normal range: 150000-450000/cumm
    * Interpretation: Normal, indicating an adequate number of platelets, which are necessary for blood clotting.

**Overall Assessment:**

Based on this blood test, your physical health appears to be:

* **Normal:** All parameters are within the normal ranges, indicating that there are no underlying medical conditions affecting your blood cells.
* **Stable:** Your blood profile has remained stable over time, as indicated by previous blood tests.
* **Well-Balanced:** The ratio of different types of blood cells is within normal limits, indicating a well-functioning immune system.
