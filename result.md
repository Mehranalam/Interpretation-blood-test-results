## Blood Test Interpretation

**Overall:**

Your blood test results indicate that you have a slightly elevated hemoglobin level (12.5 g/dL), which may indicate dehydration or an underlying medical condition. The rest of the parameters are within the normal range.

**Red Blood Cells:**

* Hemoglobin (Hb): 12.5 g/dL (normal range: 12-16 g/dL)
* Red Blood Cell (RBC) count: 5.2 million/cumm (normal range: 4.5-5.9 million/cumm)
* Packed Cell Volume (PCV): 57.5% (normal range: 35-45%)
* Mean Cell Volume (MCV): 87.75 fL (normal range: 80-100 fL)
* Mean Cell Hemoglobin (MCH): 27.2 pg (normal range: 27-32 pg)
* Mean Cell Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC): 32.8 g/dL (normal range: 32-36 g/dL)
* Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW): 13.6% (normal range: 11.5-14.5%)

**White Blood Cells:**

* White Blood Cell (WBC) count: 9000/cumm (normal range: 4000-11000/cumm)
* Neutrophils: 60% (normal range: 50-70%)
* Lymphocytes: 31% (normal range: 20-40%)
* Monocytes: 7% (normal range: 2-10%)
* Eosinophils: 1% (normal range: 1-3%)
* Basophils: 1% (normal range: 0-1%)

**Platelets:**

* Platelet Count: 150,000/cumm (normal range: 150,000-400,000/cumm)

**Discussion:**

Your blood test shows a slightly elevated hemoglobin level, indicating potential dehydration or an underlying condition. However, further evaluation is necessary to determine the exact cause. The rest of the parameters fall within normal ranges and do not indicate any significant abnormalities.

**Recommendations:**

It is important to discuss these results with your doctor for further interpretation and management. Your doctor may recommend additional tests or treatments based on your specific symptoms and medical history.
